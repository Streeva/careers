# ![Streeva](images/careers.png "Streeva") Coding Challenges

Welcome to the careers repository for Streeva, to see what positions we currently have open please visit [the careers page](https://streeva.com/careers/) on our website.

We understand interviews themselves can be stressful and don't always allow you to present your skills as well as you might prefer, so to help with this our interview process involves a "take-home" code test. These tasks are designed to take no more than 2-3 hours to complete but you are free to spend as much time as you would like on them.

Up for the challenge? Have a go at one of our tests by clicking the position most relevant to you here:

* [Frontend Engineer](frontend.engineer/)
* [Core Engineer](core.engineer/)

Please submit your solutions to careers@streeva.com

Things to include in your submission:

1. Source code, or details of how to access your solution (such as drop box, or github links)
2. An outline of how long it took you to reach your solution
